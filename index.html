  <p id="teamIntro">We are Invicta Ferro Canibus (IFC), the FIRST Tech Challenge robotics team from Pasadena High
    School!</p>

  <p id="FTCIntro">The FIRST Tech Challenge is a global robotics competition where teams of middle and high schoolers
    design, build, and program a robot based on a challenge provided by FIRST. Starting in September, teams compete
    against each other at league meets every 3-4 weeks in a 2 versus 2 format to earn points. Teams also do outreach in
    their community, such as volunteering or working with local organizations.</p>
